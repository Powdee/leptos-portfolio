One of the engineers responsible for the micro-frontend architecture, documentation, diagrams, etc... <br /> <br />  My main focus was on two features, one of which was the <b>Alteryx Plans</b> feature. The goal was to enable anyone to operationalize and automate data workflows, with options for parallel or conditional execution, as well as pre- and post-processing. We used <b>Go.JS</b> and <b>React</b> for displaying tools on the canvas and <b>NodeJS</b> on the backend. There was a significant amount of refactoring as we reverse-engineered the Alteryx Cloud canvas. The team <b>successfully delivered</b> all promised features within Alteryx Plans. <br /><br /> The second significant feature was the <b>Platform Common</b>, which allowed other teams/micro-frontends to use best practices, components, utils, etc... Additionally, we were responsible for maintaining the main repository where all micro-frontends were embedded."
