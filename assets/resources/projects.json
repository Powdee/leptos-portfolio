Initially, I worked on a platform hub for credentials and connections, which, despite its potential, wasn't launched. Subsequently, I contributed to a project similar to what is now Alteryx's Platform 1.0, focusing on both frontend and backend scheduling. \n With the shift to Platform 2.0, we embraced a micro-frontend architecture, enhancing feature documentation with detailed diagrams and documents, where I focused on scheduling.  \n My time at Alteryx was rewarding, leading a talented team of engineers. Embracing the need for new challenges, I made the decision to advance my career journey.  \n"
