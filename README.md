# Erik Kurjak - Curriculum Vitae üßëüèº‚Äçüíª

My personal website build with Rust (leptos), wasm bindgen, tailwind css for styling, little bit of HTMX (just for the sake of being cool) and deployed to cloud using fly.io with CI github actions.

## Design ‚úçÔ∏è

Before I began implementing my website, I sketched the design, including typography and color palette, using Figma. It's not perfect, and it didn't need to be, as my main focus was on the technical aspects of the website.

## Why Rust - Leptos ü§∑ ?

I have built few application in Rust. Solved leet codes issue with it and fell in love with it.

When I've decided that I want to build my portfolio (5th time) I was on a fence whether I want to use NextJS, Gatsby, Svelte or other JS framework. Then I remebered that Rust is compatible with wasm and there is a framework called Yew. After a research I decided to go with <b>Leptos</b>.

A full-stack, isomorphic Rust web framework leveraging fine-grained reactivity to build declarative user interfaces.

Over engineering at it's best, would you agree ? üòÄ Nonetheless I went for it and here are the results.

## Installing dependencies

Install `Rust` on your machine - make sure you have at least `1.70` version of Rust or newer.
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

We need to install `node` dependencies for Tailwind and JS related work.

Make sure you have at least `Node 18` or newer.

Then run

`npm i`

If you don't have `cargo-leptos` installed you can install it with

`cargo install cargo-leptos`

## Running your project locally

`cargo leptos watch`

By default, you can access website at
`http://localhost:3000`

In other terminal window we need to turn on our watcher for `tailwind css`.

`npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./style/main.css --watch  `

This will build our css and each change to either rust files or adding a new tailwding class to rust file will trigger hot reload.

## Running your project locally with Docker

To run this website on your local docker you need to have Docker installed.

If you have docker installed run:

`docker-compose up --build`

After succesfull build you should see in your terminal

`leptos-cv-web-1  | listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000`

## CI pipeline

Each commit should have three prefixes:

**feat** - developing/creating someting new on website - this will trigger deployment

**fix** - fixing a bug on website - this will trigger deployment

**chore** - updating non coding stuff such as README, documentation etc... - this won't trigger deployment

Other prefixes or commit without prefix won't do deploy and will fail CI pipeline.

## TODO

- Use wGPU for basic 2D/3D animation on website
- Write an article about my journey using Rust for my portfolio
- Create custom Headless CMS for this website
